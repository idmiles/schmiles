This is my first project with git, it's just my personal website uploaded here, I'm learning how to use the tools.

The website has been hosted on my home server for a while which has been a great exercise in learning tech, but the uptime isn't what I would like it to be.

I have transferred one of the other sites I have onto the Cloudflare Pages system, and would like to do so with this site as well, but with the additional dynamism of being integrated into git.

Using GitHub as my repository and Cloudflare as my 'host' I now have a website hosted for only the yearly cost of my domain, with accessibility for revisions and improvements from anywhere on the planet!
