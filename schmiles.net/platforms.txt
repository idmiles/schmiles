Platforms are probably the right choice.
But I've got this instead.

And what is this? 

It's a personal website! 
Ooh, so 90's (or was it early 2000's?)

I own all of the stuff on this site.
Nobody is stealing your data (though robots are definitely scraping mine!)
I am creating it and sharing it as an exercise in creativity and sharing.

And y'know, maybe someday I'll go back to platforms. 

But then again, maybe I won't.

Maybe this will become something.
Maybe this is the start of something more.

And if it isn't, well:

"Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."
- Kurt Vonnegut
